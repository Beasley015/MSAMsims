# MSAMsims
Data simulations and testing multi-species abundance models

The R scripts and associated files herein contain simulated abundance data for testing the accuracy and some of the assumptions of multi-species abundance models (MSAMs). 

Currently, the following scripts are in the repository:
* "MySim.SansCovs" - The base model. No covariates or data augmentation.
